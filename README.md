Analyzing and Comparing Different Users of CrossValidated R

With rapid development of online learning, number of users on online discussion forums have increased by huge number. On various online discussion forums one can look into statistics of a particular user but cannot visualize statistics for more than one users simultaneously. In this paper, we have implemented a visualization in which two different users on CrossValidated forum can be compared based on their profile i.e. number of posts, score , reputation, votes and views. One can also compare text/words used by users in their posts. Text Modeling has been implemented to show comparative analysis of texts of two different users. This paper visualizes users specifically who have posted question/answer in R domain. This visualization also tries to find correlation between different features of user profile.
